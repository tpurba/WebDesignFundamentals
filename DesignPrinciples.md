    # 4️⃣ Design Awareness (Huge Career Multiplier)

    You mentioned earlier you're not strong at design — this is GOOD awareness.

    You don't need to be a designer, but you must:
    - Recognize good vs bad spacing
    - Understand typography hierarchy
    - Use consistent scales

    ## Learn these 5 rules:

    ### 1. Spacing consistency (4/8px system)
    - All spacing is a multiple of 4 or 8

    ### 2. Visual hierarchy
    - Always ask "What should I look at first?"
    - Hierarchy created by:
        - Size
        - Weight
        - Contrast
        - Spacing

    ### 3. Alignment > decoration
    - Clean alignment beats:
        - Borders
        - Shadows
        - Lines
        - Boxes

    ### 4. Fewer colors (2–3 max)
    - **1 neutral base (gray)** — Used for structure
    - **1 primary** — Primary action
    - **1 accent** — Destructive action

    ### 5. White space is a feature
    - Empty space is not wasted
    - It's what makes content readable
